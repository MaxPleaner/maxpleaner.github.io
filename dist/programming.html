    </ul><p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
    <p>After graduating from UCSC with a Politics degree in 2013, I immediately started learning to code, using teach-yourself style curriculums such as <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and eventually attending <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">App Academy</a>.</p>
    <p>I then worked at a number of small startups (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sobrr">Sobrr</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/timeset-inc">Timeset</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/atipica">Atipica</a>), mainly doing Backend and API development using Rails.</p>
    <p>Next I worked at <a href="https://www.edcast.com/">Edcast</a> for two years, beginning as a backend Rails developer but ending up as the Analytics lead, using InfluxDB and Golang to record all the user activity on the site and structure it for scalability and analysis.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked at <a href="http://hover.to">Hover</a> since 2019. Have worked on many projects here, including the core Rails backend, front end with React + Native, internal tools. However, due to my interests in the 3D space I’ve been transitioning away from web dev a bit and towards modeling tools. Recently I’ve been working on Blender and Sketchup plugins to automatically extract measurements from 3D models (of home interiors).</p>
    <p><strong>Skillset</strong></p>
    <p>Having primarily worked as a backend engineer for 6+ years, I’m very familiar with backend architectures, both in terms of feature-building and in scalability / maintainability / code quality.</p>
    <p>Although it’s not my specialty per se, I do enjoy front end work with Javascript. I’m much more into the data-flow aspect than with pixel pushing CSS, which admittedly I never quite mastered (if you couldn’t guess from this site’s style …)</p>
    <p>Although I usually work with OOP-focused languages, I often incorporate functional programming techniques, and am a real stickler for documentation and readability. Very experienced writing automated tests (including browser automation).</p>
    <p>More recently, I have gotten hooked on algorithmic design and computational geometry.</p>
